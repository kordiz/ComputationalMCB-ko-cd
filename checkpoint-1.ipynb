Groups with higher sampling frequency were often only identified to the phylum level, and the most frequently sampled group were unclassified bacteria. Acidobacteria (a phylum) was one of the most frequently seen phylums, and many acidobacteria are acidophillic, so this soil may have a low pH. The most frequently sampled bacteria that was identified to genus is Streptomyces. In total, there were 6032 unique identifications."
